# Decentralized Insurance Platform

The Decentralized Insurance Platform is a blockchain-based platform that provides transparent, secure, and automated insurance services. This project leverages the power of smart contracts to manage insurance policies, process claims, and handle payouts efficiently.

## Features

### 1. Policy Management

- Create, read, update, and delete insurance policies.
- Each policy includes details such as policyholder information, coverage amount, premium, and policy duration.

### 2. Claim Management

- File and manage insurance claims.
- Claims include details such as claim amount, incident description, and status (pending, approved, rejected).

### 3. Automated Payouts

- Smart contracts handle automated payouts based on predefined conditions.
- Claims are assessed and processed automatically, reducing administrative overhead and delays.

### 4. Policyholder Verification

- Identity verification mechanisms ensure that users participating in the insurance process are authenticated and authorized.

### 5. Transaction History

- Maintain a transaction history for each policy and claim.
- Record details of policy creation, updates, claim filings, and status changes.
